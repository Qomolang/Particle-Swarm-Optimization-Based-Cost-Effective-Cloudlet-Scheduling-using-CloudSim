# Particle-Swarm-Optimization-Based-Cost-E-ective-Cloudlet-Scheduling-using-CloudSim

##Problem Statement
The problem at hand is to minimize the total cost of processing cloudlets by optimal scheduling on given Virtual Machines. Our hypothesis is that we can obtain better cost using Particle Swarm Optimization to schedule our tasks as compared to Random Scheduling algorithm.
